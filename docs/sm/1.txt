Plotting Vectors
Version 1 Created by Jonathan M. on 30 May 2009.
Zhaohuan,

Yes, use the vpl macro. I don’t know if the twod.m file I gave you has the updated version of vpl or not. I recall making changes to vpl so it’s more like plc in it’s ability to handle 3D, etc.

You use it by doing, e.g.,

set vx = vectorx

set vy = vectory

vpl 0 v 1 12

I think in the code you have that vx and vy already exist, so it’s ready to be used immediately without setting anything first.

If you want to see a log type plot do:

vpl 0 v 1 12 100

and you can overlay or choose “limits” for the range you want to show.

Some interesting global parameters to define:

PLANE : usually 3 for you since 2D

WHICHLEV : usually 1 since you are 2D

SKIPFACTOR: factor of points skipped in plot (often too many vectors)

UNITVECTOR: if defined to 1, then ignore length of vector and just plot direction.

I’ll get to your other question at some point…I’ve been busy preparing and giving a talk.

-Jon

Hello Jon,

I wonder do you have sm programs to plot vector velocity (small arrows) in a plot together with density contour as you did in your 2002 paper.

Thanks,

Zhaohuan
