\title{Reduction to Entropy Equation}

%\author{}
GRMHD codes occasionally have difficulties handling the energy
equation. One then uses entropy evolution as a backup. When we have
only gas and magnetic fields, the entropy equation is
straightforward. The gas entropy per unit mass is
\begin{equation}
s_{\rm gas} = \frac{k}{(\gamma-1)m}\ln \left(\frac{p}{\rho^\gamma}\right)
=\frac{k}{m}\ln \left(\frac{p^n}{\rho^{n+1}}\right),
\qquad \gamma = 1+\frac{1}{n},
\end{equation}
and the entropy per unit volume is
\begin{equation}
S_{\rm gas} = \rho s_{\rm gas},
\end{equation}
where $p$ and $\rho$ are measured in the gas rest frame. For entropy
evolution, we say that the gas entropy per unit mass is conserved
(temporarily ignoring shocks and reconnection), hence
\begin{equation}
\frac{ds_{\rm gas}}{d\tau} = 0, \quad {\rm i.e.}\quad
\left(\rho s_{\rm gas} u^\mu \right)_{;\mu} = 0.
\end{equation}

In the case of radiation hydrodynamics or radiation MHD, the gas
entropy is no longer conserved because there is energy transfer
between gas and radiation. In the fluid rest frame, let $\hat{E}_{\rm
  rad}$ be the total radiation energy density, $\hat{B}$ be the
frequency integrated blackbody intensity corresponding to the
temperature $T_{\rm gas}$ of the gas, and $\kappa$ be the frequency-integrated
absorption opacity coefficient. Then, gas entropy evolution in the
fluid frame is described by
\begin{equation}
T_{\rm gas}\frac{ds_{\rm gas}}{d\tau} = \frac{dQ_{\rm gas}}{d\tau} = \kappa
(c\hat{E}_{\rm rad}-4\pi\hat{B}).
\end{equation}
In four notation we write this as ({\bf correct?})
\begin{equation}
\left(\rho s_{\rm gas} u^\mu \right)_{;\mu} = 
\frac{\rho\kappa (c\hat{E}_{\rm rad}-4\pi\hat{B})}{T_{\rm gas}}.
\end{equation}

The entropy equation for the radiation is slightly more complicated
since there are two terms on the rhs: (i) energy transfer from/to the
gas (rhs of eq.~4 with the opposite sign), and (ii) energy gain due to
radiation flow: $-\vec{\nabla}\cdot\hat{\vec{F}}_{\rm rad}$.
