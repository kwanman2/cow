How to use "svn diff" and "svn log" and "svn info"
Version 1 Created by Jonathan M. on 24 Jun 2009.
It appears svn diff does many nice things (see “svn help diff”):

1) For example:

svn diff -r HEAD

will difference your local working copy with the latest repository copy.

2) To see how revision 72 differs from revisoin 73, do:

svn diff -r 72:73

3) The normal:

svn diff

just differences your local working copy with the locally stored copy of the last revision updated to.

So use “svn diff -r HEAD” and it’ll show you all changes made compared to the latest revision. Good to do “svn diff” to see what you yourself changed. Good to do both before committing changes.

4) You can see the difference between any two files among any two revisions by doing:

svn diff -r 88:89 initbase.enerregions.c

And so forth.

Also useful is:

svn info

and:

svn log

the latter of which shows all commit/import messages for each revision.

Here are some neat front-ends to SVN:

RapidSVN + Meld diff tool (which you specify in RapidSVN settings).

Does a great job at comparing revisions since it highlightes exactly which words on a line were changed rather than the whole line that was different.
