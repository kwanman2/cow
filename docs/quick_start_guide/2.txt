2) Compile r8toras/r8toras.c in HARMJON tree to quickly view .r8 files (uses Imagemagick's display program)
Version 6 Created by Jonathan M. at 6:14pm. Previous Version
*Compile r8toras:*

1) Go to primary HARM directory

2) cd r8toras

3) gcc -lm -O3 -Wall -o r8toras r8toras.c

[On some computers, apparently gcc doesn't work with -lm for unknown reason.  If that happens, then use g++ seems to work fine.]

4) Move "r8toras" binary to somewhere in your path (e.g. ~/bin/ if that's in your path. In bash, add something like: export PATH=~/bin/:$PATH to .profile or .bash_profile or .bashrc).

mv r8toras ~/bin/

5) Change name of "r8toras":

mv ~/bin/r8toras ~/bin/r8torasjon

6) Also copy "dr8" and "dr82" to somewhere in your path (e.g. ~/bin/)

7) 

7a) IF ON UBUNTU: Install Imagemagik packages (binary, libs, and dev stuff).

7b) IF NOT ON UBUNTU: Download and install "Imagemagik" so you have "display" binary

http://www.imagemagick.org/script/index.php

a) If you install as your own user:

i) Run with <homedir> replaced with your absolute (and don't use ~) home directory path:

./configure --prefix=<homedir> --exec-prefix=<homedir> --oldincludedir=<homedir>/oldinclude/ --without-perl
make
make install

ii) This requires changes to your file called ~/.profile or similar start-up shell file (e.g. ~/.bashrc ):

export PATH=~/bin/:$PATH
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$LD_LIBRARY_PATH:~/lib/

b) If you can install as root, then just run:

./configure
make
make install

8) Unzip r8toras/pal.zip to ~/bin/


*View first log(rest-mass) image:*

1) Run HARM code as from SVN as in Quick Start Guide

2) cd images

3) dr8 im0p0s0l0000.r8
