How to use "svn checkout" and "svn export"
Version 1 Created by Jonathan M. on 24 Jun 2009.
Apart from checking out the latest repository, you can checkout any revision. See “svn help checkout”.

1) Equivalent to without @HEAD, which checks out latest in repository:

svn checkout https://harm.unfuddle.com/svn/harm_harm/@HEAD .

2) Checking out a particular revision number 72:

svn checkout https://harm.unfuddle.com/svn/harm_harm/@72 .

So one can always revert to a prior revision.

Thus, it may be a good idea to (when posting a commit) to state clearly how well tested that revision being committed is. For example, one should do:

svn commit -m “FULLY TESTED: Normal comments”
svn commit -m “PARTIALLY TESTED: Normal comments”
svn commit -m “NOT TESTED: Normal comments”

This way one can expect whether or not the code should work when looking at a prior revision when, e.g., debugging why something doesn’t work anymore.

————————

The “svn export” is useful when you don’t want to ever edit the code or keep track of revisions. Just do:

svn export https://harm.unfuddle.com/svn/harm_harm/@HEAD .

Then there will be no “.svn” files, etc.
